\# Memory Bank Policy (must follow)



Before starting any task, the Admin/Supervisor must:



1\) Read these files first:

\- docs/memory/PROJECT\_STATE.md

\- docs/memory/DECISIONS.md

\- docs/memory/CHECKLIST.md

\- docs/memory/SECRETS\_POLICY.md

\- docs/memory/TOOLING.md



2\) Update PROJECT\_STATE.md when:

\- a milestone is completed

\- the plan changes

\- new constraints are discovered



3\) Update CHECKLIST.md when:

\- tasks are completed

\- new tasks are created



4\) Never invent requirements:

\- If unsure, check memory bank first.

\- If still unsure, ask user a single focused question.
